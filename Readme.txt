Using: JQuery + KnockoutJs
Additional Libraries Used:
- Bootstrap
- jQuery Templateing


Considerations / Observations:
------------------------------
- Best viewed using webserver i.e. apache; ajax requests / processing might be blocked otherwise.
- Usually I prefer using PHP SSI (server side includes); used JQuery Templating for this assignment
- Code uses several internal and third-party libraries (CSS & JS) and hence make many HTTP requests; can be improved using Minification library (combine, minify, gzip).
